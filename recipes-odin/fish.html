              <h3>Instructions</h3>
              <p>1. Begin with washing the fish pieces thoroughly under running water. Pat dry and keep aside in a strainer till the water drains out.</p>
              <p>2. Take a tray and marinate with yoghurt, garlic paste, ginger paste, turmeric and salt..</p>
              <p>3. Add all the ingredients (except oil) to the fish and mix well. Keep aside for half an hour.</p>
              <p>4. Now heat oil in a deep fry pan to shallow fry the fish pieces one by one, keeping the flame low. Drain the fried fish pieces and place on an absorbent paper to remove excess oil.</p>
              <p>5. Serve the Fish Fry hot with green chutney and onion rings. You can also serve it with mustard sauce or any dip!</p>
