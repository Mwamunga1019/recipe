              <h3>Instructions</h3>
              <p>1. Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</p>
              <p>2. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</p>
              <p>3. Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. </p>
              <p>4. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</p>
              <p>5. Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
              <p>6. Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</p>
